# Hand Sign Language Classification with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand sign language images. The model uses TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from a custom dataset of hand sign images. This repository contains the code and necessary files to train and test the model.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a CNN for classifying images of hand signs, which can be used for interpreting sign language in real-time applications.The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained to recognize various hand signs by learning features from the images.

The CNN model is designed to take input images of size 64x64 pixels and output the predicted sign class.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `Keras`

To install the dependencies, you can run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas keras
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is available as `handsignimages`. The dataset contains images of hand signs categorized into multiple classes.

The dataset is divided into two main folders:
- `Train`: Contains images for training the model.
- `Test`: Contains images for evaluating the model.

You can upload the dataset to Kaggle or provide the path to your local dataset directory in the code.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used in this project consists of:

1. **Convolutional Layer (Conv2D)**: Extracts features from the input images.
2. **Max Pooling Layer (MaxPool2D)**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
3. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D feature map into a 1D vector.
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for final classification.

The final layer uses the `softmax` activation function to output the probability of each class.

### Key Hyperparameters:
- Input shape: (64, 64, 3)
- Activation functions: ReLU (for hidden layers), Softmax (for output layer)
- Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Number of epochs: 25

## Training the Model

To train the model, run the notebook `hand_sign_classification.ipynb`. It will:

1. Preprocess the dataset (resize, rescale, augment images).
2. Train the CNN model using the training data.
3. Evaluate the model on the test data.

### Example command to run:

```bash
jupyter notebook hand_sign_classification.ipynb
```

This will start the training process and display the accuracy for each epoch.

## Testing with New Images

Once the model is trained, you can test it using new hand sign images. The following steps can be used:

1. Upload the image you want to test in the project directory.
2. Use the `predict()` method to classify the image based on the trained model.

### Example code to test a new image:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

img_path = 'path_to_your_image'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(64, 64))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = img_array / 255.0
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

prediction = cnn.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)

class_names = list(training_set.class_indices.keys())
predicted_class_name = class_names[predicted_class[0]]

print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class_name}")
```

## Results

The model achieves a classification accuracy of **92%** on the test dataset.
